## Configuration

You'll need `.env` and `.env.local`. Contact an admin for these.


## Run in development

Clone the repo, then navigate to the root of the project (where `package.json` lives) and run:

```
> npm install
```


Finally, run 
```
> npm run dev
```
 in a terminal window, and in browser your navigate to *localhost:3000*. Currently the project is best viewed in mobile (open the web Inspector and toggle device view).

## Migrate the DB after schema change
```
> npx prisma migrate dev
```
This will also seed the database using *prisma/seed.ts*
